Abstract: Geospatial research and education have become increasingly dependent on  cyberGIS to tackle computation and data challenges. However, the use of  advanced cyberinfrastructure resources for geospatial research and  education is extremely challenging due to both high learning curve for  users and high software development and integration costs for  developers, due to limited availability of middleware tools available to make such resources easily accessible. This tutorial describes  CyberGIS-Compute as a middleware framework that addresses these  challenges and provides access to high-performance resources through  simple easy to use interfaces. The CyberGIS-Compute framework provides  an easy to use application interface and a Python SDK to provide access  to CyberGIS capabilities, allowing geospatial applications to easily  scale and employ advanced cyberinfrastructure resources. In this  tutorial, we will first start with the basics of CyberGIS-Jupyter and  CyberGIS-Compute, then introduce the Python SDK for CyberGIS-Compute  with a simple Hello World example. Then, we will take multiple  real-world geospatial applications use-cases like spatial accessibility  and wildfire evacuation simulation using agent based modeling. We will  also provide pointers on how to contribute applications to the  CyberGIS-Compute framework.
