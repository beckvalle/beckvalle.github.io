Abstract: A signalling system between Hadrian’s Wall and the Stanegate Frontier has been suggested as a reason for deviations between actual and expected spacing of milecastles along Hadrian’s Wall (Woolliscroft, 2001, 63). Expected positions for milecastles are positions where a milecastle would have been placed had it been built one Roman mile (1479 metres) from the milecastle to its east. Measured positions for turrets are 1/3rd of a Roman mile (493 metres) from the turret or milecastle to the east. This report assesses intervisibility between measured and actual Wall positions and Stanegate forts and towers. Positions for both milecastles and turrets measured from the east and the west are considered. Comparisons are also made between actual milecastle and turret positions and local hills and valleys, Wall corners, and random positions. A fuzzy decay equation was applied to binary intervisibility scores to account for distance effects. No significant differences were found between actual Wall positions and other positions (except for valleys), which suggests that milecastles and turrets were not moved from measured positions in order to better signal to Stanegate forts or towers.
