Abstract: Geospatial research and education have become increasingly dependent on  cyberGIS, defined as geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI), [1] to tackle computation and data  challenges. However, the use of advanced cyberGIS capabilities has  typically been constrained to a small set of research groups who have  the technical expertise of using CI resources. Over the past few years  CyberGIS-Jupyter [2,3] has been developed to provide access to cyberGIS  capabilities through an easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook interface which has made cyberGIS more accessible. For many cyberGIS and geospatial  applications accessing CI resources needed for solving complex problems  at scale. However, leveraging CI resources for geospatial application is challenging both due to the steep learning curve and lack of  appropriate tools. CyberGIS-Compute fills this gap by providing an  easy-to-use middleware tool for using and contributing geospatial  application codes that leverage CI resources. This substantially lowers  the learning curve for both geospatial users and developers to access  cyberGIS capabilities at scale. CyberGIS-Compute is backed by Virtual  ROGER (Resourcing Open Geospatial Education and Research); a geospatial  supercomputer with access to a number of readily available popular  geospatial libraries.

 With CyberGIS-Compute we have designed an easy-to-use middleware and  associated Python SDK to provide access to CyberGIS capabilities,  allowing geospatial applications to easily scale and employ advanced  cyberinfrastructure resources. This presentation will first describe the basics of CyberGIS-Jupyter and CyberGIS-Compute, then introduce the  Python SDK for CyberGIS-Compute with a simple example. Then, we will  take multiple real-world geospatial applications use-cases like spatial  accessibility and wildfire evacuation simulation using agent based  modeling. Lastly, we will also descrive mechanism to contribute  applications to the CyberGIS-Compute framework.
